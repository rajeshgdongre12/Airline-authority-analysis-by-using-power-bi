# Airline-authority-analysis-by-using-power-bi

This project is a Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into airline performance and traffic trends using historical flight data. The dashboard allows users to interactively explore airline performance metrics, helping identify patterns in delays, cancellations, and overall flight behavior.

# Project Overview

The Airline Authority Analysis and Airline Traffic dashboards were developed to assist stakeholders—such as aviation authorities, airline companies, and airport management—in making data-driven decisions based on flight performance data.

# Key Features

# Airline Authority Analysis 
- Flight Status Overview: Breakdown of the number of cancelled, delayed, and on-time flights.
- Weekly Trends: Visual representation of flight outcomes (cancelled, delayed, on-time) across different days of the week.
- Delay by Airline and Year: Bar chart showing average delay times by airline from 2009 to 2011.
- Interactive Filters: Filter data by month and airline name for more focused analysis.
- Pie Chart Summary: Percentage distribution of flight statuses across the dataset.

# Airline Traffic Analysis
- Flight Traffic by Hour: Bar chart depicting the number of flights at different hours of the day.
- Filters for In-Depth Exploration:
  - Origin Airport
  - Day of the Week
  - Month
  - Airline Name

# Tools Used
- Power BI for dashboard development and data visualization.
- Microsoft Excel / CSV as the data source (assumed).

# Insights You Can Gain
- Identify the busiest and least busy days of the week for airlines.
- Discover which airlines have the highest average delays.
- Determine the peak hours for flight traffic across different airports.
- Explore seasonal patterns and performance differences across months.

# How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with filters (months, airlines, airports) to drill down into specific data points.
3. Analyze charts for operational bottlenecks or performance improvements.
